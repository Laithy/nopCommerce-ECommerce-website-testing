 A Script used to test a number of functions like registration, login, searching for a specific product, adding it to the 
wishlist, and finally adding the product to the cart in a demo eCommerce website 
"https://demo.nopcommerce.com".
 I opted to use behavior-driven test development method so I used Selenium with Cucumber and Gherken to write 
the scripts for the test cases and check the actual results and compare them with the expected results, I later 
implemented POM design pattern for a cleaner code and to be able to make modifications in the future easily, I 
then wrote a Test runner for regression testing in the future.
